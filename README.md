# Similaritipsum
implementation of streaming service of lorem ipsum words that inspects similarity between texts. 
For every n words from a generated set of streams, application compares text(do they have same words, letters in a word, etc.) 


# Installation
1.) Clone repository<br>
2.) Install docker to your machine<br>
3.) In terminal type docker-compose up -d --build<br>
4.) Open localhost:8080 webpage<br>

# TO DO
Due to crash of https://baconipsum.com/ page from where generated text is taken and lack of time, it is still left to do:<br>
1.) Better comparison(letters in a word, number of words, number of sentences,...)<br>
2.) Add symphony to a project<br>
3.) Cleaner code<br>
